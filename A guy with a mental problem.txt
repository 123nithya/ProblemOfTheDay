/*
	A guy has to reach his home and does not want to be late. He takes train to reach home. He has a mental illness, so he always switches train at every station.
For eg: If he starts with train A then at station 2 he will switch his train to train B and so on. Similarly, if he starts with train B then he will switch to train A at station 2 and so on. Please help him to find the minimum total time he would take to reach his home.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
A[] = {2, 1, 2}
B[] = {3, 2, 1}
Output:
5
Explanation:
If he chose train A initially, then time to
reach home will be : 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 
If he Chose train B initially, then time to
reach home will be : 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
5 is minimum hence the answer.
*/
SOLUTION:

class Solution
{
	public long minTime(long a[],long b[],long n)
	{
		long ans1 = 0;long ans2 = 0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			if(i%2==0)
			{
				ans1+=a[(int)i];
			}
			else
			{
				ans2+=a[(int)i];
			}
		}
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			if(i%2!=0)
			{
				ans1+=b[i];
			}
			else
			{
				ans2+=b[i];
			}
		}
		long min = Math.min(ans1,ans2);
		return min;
	}
