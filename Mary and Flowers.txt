	Problem Statement
One day, Mary wanted to give a present to her friend. She decided on a beautiful bouquet of flowers and began collecting them. She needed precisely 2 types of flowers, and the total number of flowers required was 't'. To gather these, she started picking from her garden, which contained 'N' types of flowers. Each type was arranged in a queue in non-decreasing order, such as 1, 3, 6, 15, and so forth.

Now, she seeks your help in determining the indexes of the flowers she should collect.

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
5 2
1 1 2 3 4
Testcase Output
0 1

Explanation
Flowers at 0th and 1st indexes sum up to the target only i.e. 1 + 1 = 2.

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
7 5
1 2 2 4 5 7 10
Testcase Output
0 3

Explanation
Flowers at 0th and 3rd indexes sum up to the target only i.e. 1 + 4 = 5 .
