/*
	You are given an array A of size N. The task is to find count of elements before which all the elements are smaller. First element is always counted as there is no other element before it.

 

Example 1:

Input : 
arr[] =  {10, 40, 23, 35, 50, 7}
Output : 
3

Output : 
1
Explanation :
There is only one element 5
No of element is 1
*/
SOLUTION:

class Solution
{
	public static long countElement(long arr[],int n)
	{
		int cnt =1;
		long max = arr[0];
		for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
		{
			if(arr[i]>max)
			{
				cnt++;
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		return cnt;
	}
