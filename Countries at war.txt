/*
	The two countries of A and B are at war against each other. Both countries have N number of soldiers. The power of these soldiers are given by A[i]...A[N] and B[i]....B[N].
These soldiers have a peculiarity. They can only attack their counterpart enemies, like A[i] can attack only B[i] and not anyone else. A soldier with higher power can kill the enemy soldier. If both soldiers have the same power, they both die. You need to find the winner country.

Example 1:

â€‹Input : a[ ] = {2, 2}, b[ ] = {5, 5}
Output : B
Explanation:
Both countries have 2 soldiers.
B[0] kills A[0], B[1] kills A[1]. 
A has 0 soldiers alive at the end. 
B has both soldiers alive at the end.
Return "B" as a winner.

â€‹Example 2:

Input : a[ ] = {9}, b[ ] = {8}  
Output :  A
