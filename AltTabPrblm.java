     Given an integer K and an array arr[] of N integers which contains the ids of
     the opened apps in a system where

     1. arr[0] is the app currently in use
     2. arr[1] is the app which was most recently used and
     3. arr[N-1] is the app which was least recently used.

     The task is to print the contents of the array when the user using the
     system presses Alt+Tab exactly K number of times. Note that after pressing
     Alt + Tab key , app opening pointer will move through apps from 0th index towards
     right, depending upon the number of presses, so the app on which the press
     ends will shift to 0th index, because that will become the most recently
     opened app.

     EXAMPLE:
     input :
*/

public class AltTabPrblm {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    }
}
