/*
	Junior high college is holding elections for the next student representative of the college. Due to pandemic, physically casting votes is not possible and the students decided to make an online website for collecting the votes of students. The entire website is built but only the algorithm that finds out who won the election is not coded yet and the student team is not ale to figure out the solution so they approach you to solve it.Your task is to find the majority votes.

INPUT:
7
1 1 3 1 1 2 2

OUTPUT:
1

EXPLANATION:

Number of votes to candidate 1 = 4.
Number of votes to candidate 2 = 2.
Number of votes to candidate 3 = 1.
Majority candidate number = 1.
*/

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;
class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int arr[] = new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = 0;
		for(int num:arr)
		{
			max = Math.max(num,max);
		}
		int freq[] = new int[max+1];
		for(int numb:arr)
		{
			freq[numb]++;
		}
		int maxFreq = 0;
		for(int maxNum: freq)
		{
			maxFreq = Math.max(maxNum,maxFreq);
		}
		System.out.print(arr[maxFreq]);
	}
