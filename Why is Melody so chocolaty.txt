	Chunky gets happy by eating Melody.
Given an array of N elements, each element represents happiness chunky get by eating melody.
Chunky knows why melody is so chocolaty but will only tell you once you tell him the Max happiness he can get by eating two adjacent melodies.

Example 1:

Input : arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output : 9
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] + arr[1] = 3
At index 1, arr[1] + arr[2] = 5
At index 2, arr[2] + arr[3] = 7
...
In this way, 9 will be the answer.

Example 2:

Input : arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4} 
Output :  7

SOLUTION:
class Complete{
    public static int max_adjacent_sum (int arr[], int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
        {
                sum = arr[i]+arr[i+1];
                max = Math.max(sum,max);
        }
        return max;
    }
    
    
}
