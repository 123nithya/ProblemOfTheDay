/*
	Geek is given a task to select at most 10 employees for a company project. Each employee is represented by a single digit ID number which is unique for all the selected employees for the project. Geek has a technical problem in his system which printed ID number multiple times. You are given array a[ ] of N elements having all printed IDs. Help him to get rid of the repeated IDs.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
a[ ] = {8, 8, 6, 2, 1}
Output:
8 6 2 1
Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
a[ ] = {7, 6, 7, 4, 2, 7}
Output:
7 6 4 2

SOLUTION:

class Compute {
    
    public int[] uniqueId(long arr[], long n)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(!(list.contains((int)arr[i])))
            {
                list.add((int)arr[i]);
            }
        }
        int a[] = new int[list.size()];
        for(int i=0;i<list.size();i++)
        {
            a[i] = list.get(i);
        }
        return a;
    }
